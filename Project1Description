Serverless Marketing Analytics Pipeline
Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully serverless data analytics pipeline on AWS, designed to automate marketing campaign reporting. It ingests raw campaign data, transforms it using ETL workflows, and provides actionable insights through interactive dashboardsâ€”all without manual intervention.

Key Features

Data Storage: Uses S3 as a scalable, cost-effective data lake for raw and processed data.

Serverless Processing: Python Lambda functions automatically process incoming campaign data.

ETL Automation: AWS Glue jobs clean and transform raw data for analysis.

Analytics & Visualization: Athena queries the transformed data, and QuickSight dashboards provide interactive insights.

Monitoring & Alerts: SNS notifies stakeholders of job successes or failures.

Impact

Reduced manual reporting from 4 hours to 10 minutes, enabling near real-time decision-making for marketing teams.

Demonstrates best practices in serverless architecture, IAM roles, and automated data pipelines on AWS.
